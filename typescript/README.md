# BrowserState

BrowserState is a Node.js library for managing browser profiles across different storage providers, including local storage, AWS S3, and Google Cloud Storage.


# Why BrowserState?
Most browser automation workflows fail because authentication and session data don't persist reliably across environments. Manually handling cookies or re-authenticating slows everything down. Worse, many automations fail due to inconsistent browser fingerprints, machine IDs, and storage states—leading to bot detection and bans.

BrowserState ensures your automation behaves like a real, returning user by providing:

Full Browser Context Restoration – Save and restore cookies, local storage, IndexedDB, service worker caches, and extension data. Resume automation 
from the exact previous state.

Multi-Instance Synchronization – Share browser profiles across multiple servers or devices, making automation scalable and resilient.

Zero-Setup Onboarding for Automation – Instantly deploy automation-ready browser profiles without manual setup.

Efficient Resource Usage – Persistent browser usage without memory leaks, eliminating the need to launch new instances for every run.

Faster Debugging & Reproducibility – Store failing test cases exactly as they were, making it easy to diagnose automation failures.

Offline Execution & Caching – Automate tasks that rely on cached assets, such as scraping content behind paywalls or working in low-connectivity environments.

Cross-Device Synchronization – Seamlessly move between local development, cloud servers, and headless automation.

✅ Bot Detection Bypass
Many bot detection systems track inconsistencies in browser states—frequent changes to fingerprints, device identifiers, and storage behavior trigger red flags. Most people get detected because they unknowingly create a "new machine" every time.

BrowserState solves this by preserving a stable, persistent browser identity across runs instead of resetting key markers. This drastically reduces detection risks while maintaining full automation control.

Now you can move fast without breaking sessions—or getting flagged as a bot.

## Implementation Status

| Storage Provider | Status |
|------------------|--------|
| Local Storage | ✅ Extensively tested |
| S3 Storage | ⚠️ Implemented, needs additional testing |
| GCS Storage | ✅ Tested and works, but requires more extensive testing in different environments |

Currently, we recommend using the local storage provider for production use cases. Cloud storage providers are available but should be thoroughly tested in your environment before production use.

## Installation

```bash
npm install browserstate
```

## Optional Dependencies

BrowserState supports multiple storage backends. Depending on your needs, you may want to install additional dependencies:

- For AWS S3 storage:
  ```bash
  npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/lib-storage
  ```

- For Google Cloud Storage:
  ```bash
  npm install @google-cloud/storage
  ```

## Usage

```typescript
import { BrowserState } from 'browserstate';

// Local storage
const localBrowserState = new BrowserState({
  userId: 'user123',
  storageType: 'local',
  localOptions: {
    storagePath: '/path/to/local/storage'
  }
});

// AWS S3 storage
const s3BrowserState = new BrowserState({
  userId: 'user123',
  storageType: 's3',
  s3Options: {
    bucketName: 'my-browser-states',
    region: 'us-west-2',
    accessKeyID: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
  }
});

// Google Cloud Storage
const gcsBrowserState = new BrowserState({
  userId: 'user123',
  storageType: 'gcs',
  gcsOptions: {
    bucketName: 'my-browser-states',
    projectID: 'your-project-id',
    keyFilename: '/path/to/service-account-key.json'
  }
});

// With autoCleanup disabled
const longRunningBrowserState = new BrowserState({
  userId: 'user123',
  storageType: 'local',
  autoCleanup: false, // Disable automatic cleanup
  localOptions: {
    storagePath: '/path/to/local/storage'
  }
});

// Use browser state
async function example() {
  // Mount a session
  await browserState.mount('session123');

  // Your browser automation code here...

  // Launch Chrome with the mounted profile and additional configurations
  console.log("Launching Chrome browser with additional configurations...");
  const chromeContext = await chromium.launchPersistentContext(userDataDir, {
    headless: false, // Launch in non-headless mode for visibility
    slowMo: 100, // Slow down operations for demo purposes
    userDataDir: userDataDir, // Use the userDataDir from BrowserState
    // Additional configurations can be added here as needed
  });

  // Perform browser automation tasks with the launched browser context
  // Example: Navigate to a website and perform actions
  const page = await chromeContext.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.locator('text=Click me').click();

  // Close the browser context to free up resources
  console.log("Closing Chrome browser...");
  await chromeContext.close();

  // Unmount and save the session
  await browserState.unmount();

  // List available sessions
  const sessions = await browserState.listSessions();
  console.log(sessions);

  // Delete a session
  await browserState.deleteSession('session123');
}
```

## API

### BrowserState

The main class for managing browser state.

#### Constructor Options

- `storageType`: Type of storage to use ('local', 's3', or 'gcs')
- `autoCleanup`: Whether to automatically clean up temporary files on process exit (default: true)
- `useEfficientSync`: Whether to use efficient synchronization to speed up uploads/downloads (default: false)
- `syncOptions`: Additional options for efficient synchronization
  - `metadataStorage`: Where to store metadata - 'local' or 'cloud' (default: 'local')
  - `metadataUpdateInterval`: Seconds between metadata updates when using cloud storage (default: 0 - update on every operation)
  - `localMetadataPath`: Custom path for local metadata storage (default: '~/.browserstate-metadata')
- `localOptions`: Options for local storage
  - `storagePath`: Local storage directory path
- `s3Options`: Options for AWS S3 storage

#### Methods

- `mount(sessionId: string)`: Downloads and prepares a session for use
- `unmount()`: Uploads and cleans up the current session
- `listSessions()`: Lists all available sessions for the user
- `deleteSession(sessionId: string)`: Deletes a specific session
- `cleanup()`: Manually clean up temporary files (useful when autoCleanup is disabled)

## Automatic Cleanup

BrowserState creates temporary files on your local system when working with browser profiles. By default, these files are automatically cleaned up when:

1. You call `unmount()` to save the session
2. The Node.js process exits normally
3. The process is terminated with SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
4. An uncaught exception occurs

You can disable this automatic cleanup by setting `autoCleanup: false` in the constructor options:

```typescript
const browserState = new BrowserState({
  userId: 'user123',
  storageType: 'local',
  autoCleanup: false,
  localOptions: {
    storagePath: '/path/to/local/storage'
  }
});
```

When automatic cleanup is disabled, you can manually clean up temporary files by calling:

```typescript
await browserState.cleanup();
```

This is useful in scenarios where you want more control over when cleanup occurs, such as in long-running server processes or when handling multiple browser states.

## Efficient Synchronization

When working with cloud storage providers (S3 or GCS), transferring entire browser profiles can be slow, especially for large profiles. BrowserState offers efficient synchronization to speed up this process by only transferring files that have changed.

To enable efficient synchronization, set `useEfficientSync: true` in the constructor options:

```typescript
const browserState = new BrowserState({
  userId: 'user123',
  storageType: 'gcs',
  useEfficientSync: true,
  gcsOptions: {
    bucketName: 'my-browser-states',
    projectID: 'your-project-id',
    keyFilename: '/path/to/service-account-key.json'
  }
});
```

### Advanced Synchronization Options

For more control over efficient synchronization, you can use additional configuration options:

```typescript
const browserState = new BrowserState({
  userId: 'user123',
  storageType: 'gcs',
  useEfficientSync: true,
  syncOptions: {
    // Store metadata in the cloud to support multiple services using the same profile
    metadataStorage: 'cloud',
    
    // Only update metadata every 300 seconds (5 minutes) to prevent conflicts
    metadataUpdateInterval: 300,
    
    // Custom path for storing local metadata (only applies with metadataStorage: 'local')
    localMetadataPath: '/path/to/custom/metadata/storage'
  },
  gcsOptions: {
    bucketName: 'my-browser-states',
    projectID: 'your-project-id',
    keyFilename: '/path/to/service-account-key.json'
  }
});
```

How it works:
1. BrowserState maintains a metadata file with hash information about each file in the profile
2. When uploading or downloading, only files that have changed are transferred
3. Metadata can be stored:
   - Locally in `~/.browserstate-metadata/[userId]` (default)
   - In the cloud storage alongside the profile data (set `metadataStorage: 'cloud'`)

Benefits:
- Significantly faster mount/unmount operations for large profiles
- Reduced bandwidth usage and cloud storage costs
- Improved performance for frequent operations with minimal changes

#### Multi-Service Synchronization

When multiple services or machines use the same browser profile, it's recommended to:

1. Enable cloud metadata storage: `metadataStorage: 'cloud'`
2. Set a reasonable update interval: `metadataUpdateInterval: 300` (5 minutes)

This ensures that metadata updates don't conflict when multiple services are using the same profile simultaneously. The update interval ensures that metadata is only updated periodically rather than on every operation.

Note: The first use with a session will still perform a full transfer to establish the baseline metadata.

## Issues and Feedback

If you encounter any issues or have feedback about specific storage providers:

1. Check the existing GitHub issues to see if your problem has been reported
2. Create a new issue with:
   - A clear description of the problem
   - Which storage provider you're using
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Environment details (Node.js version, browser, etc.)

We especially welcome feedback and testing reports for the S3 and GCS storage providers.
